    Expect things to never go as you expect them to go. At 8:00 p.m. last night, I began a virtual meeting with a group of friends to spend two hours
    solving some <a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com/catalogue">HackTheBox</a> (HTB) challenges. I was pumped because I hadn't worked on
    HTBs in about a year. In attendance was a friend I had dragged through the cybersecurity track in undergrad and a few of his friends who had widely 
    varying levels of CompSci knowledge.

<p>
    HackTheBox offers two hours of a ready-to-use virtual machine (called a "Pwnbox") to aid users on their hacking journey. We assumed it was two hours per 
    day or week - certainly enough time for a bi-monthly hacking meeting. However, we soon realized it was two hours total. Everyone had done their "pre-class"
    homework that my friend had assigned them: creating an HTB account and ensuring their Pwnboxes worked. However, by the time everyone was in the virtual meeting 
    and audio issues were resolved, it was 8:15 p.m. Soon after (8:30 p.m.), we realized everyone had little or no time left on their Pwnboxes, so we had to figure out an 
    alternative.

    Let's pause this story for a moment. As I said before, <i>things don't go as expected</i>... and we should expect that. I think one of the hardest things in 
    CompSci and SWE is that we spend a weirdly large amount of time working on things tangentially related to the work we planned or wanted to do (especially when 
    starting on a project). We want stuff to "just work," and it rarely does.
</p>

<p>
    We ended up working until 11:00 p.m. (planned end time: 10:00 p.m.) to install VirtualBox running ParrotOS on everyone's computer. (I hope to write another article on why tool standardization
    is important, but that is for another time.) Now that we're all on the same page, hopefully next week we can begin to actually hack, but... I'm expecting something unexpected to happen.
