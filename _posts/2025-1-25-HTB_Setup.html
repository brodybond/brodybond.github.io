    Expect things to never go as you expect them to go. I sat down last night at 8:00 pm with a friend from undergrad who I'd dragged through our university's cybersecurity
    track (he kept me sane through it though all and I probably made him lose his sanity) along with some of his friends. Our intention was to work until 10:00pm
    on some <a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com/catalogue">HackTheBox</a> (HTB) challenges and I was pumped because I hadn't completed
    a HTB in a while and because his friends had widely varying levels of CompSci knowledge (teaching time!).
</p>

<p>
    HackTheBox offers two hours of a virtual machine ("Pwnbox") to start users on their hacking journey. I thought it was two hours per day. 
    I was wrong. It is two hours period. Everyone had done their "pre-class" homework that my friend had assignment them, so they had set up a 
    HTB account and gotten their Pwnboxs running (although I'd opted to run ParrotOS via VirtualBox for other reasons). However, by the time 
    everyone was in the virtual meeting and audio issues were resolved (oops), it was 8:15pm. Soon after (8:30pm), we realized everyone had 
    little or no time left on their Pwnboxs. So, we had to figure out an alternative.
</p>

    Let's pause this story for a moment. As I said prior, <i>things don't go as expected</i>... and we should expect that. I think that one of 
    the hardest thing in CompSci and SWE is that we spend a weirdly large amount of time working on things tangentially related to the work we 
    planned or wanted to do (especially when starting on a project). We want stuff to "just work" and it rarely does. If you're a university 
    student, take this paragraph to heart - "expect the unexpected".
</p>

<p>
    To keep this post short, we worked until 11:00pm (we were supposed to end our hacking activities at 10:00pm) to install 
    standardized tools (VirtualBox running ParrotOS) on everyone's computer (I hope to write another article on why tool standardization
    is important, but that is for another time). Now that we're all on the same page, hopefully next week we can begin to actually hack,
    but... I'm expecting something unexpected to happen.
