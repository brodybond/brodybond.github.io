    Hey folks! I'm Brody, a Computer Science student at NC State. My undergraduate degree was focussed mostly on cybersecurity and software engineering, 
    so grad school has been a blast because I've gotten to learn about <i>lots</i> of things I missed in undergrad (such as data mining (this is my plug for CSC 522))!
</p>

<p>
    In addition to school, I also work as a Lab Admin for E 115 which basically means I serve as a buffer or cushion between students, TAs, and Course Instructors so
    that everyone can effectively get done what needs done. My favorite part of being a Lab Admin though are my office hours as I get to interact with students and thus 
    meet a lot of cool people; if you're an E 115 student, feel free to drop by my office hours - either for help or just to talk!
</p>

<p> 
    Currently, a few of my interests/hobbies are hiking, rock climbing, sleeping, and studying Colossians in the Bible. One of my more recent interests has been 
    photography, the results of which can be seen in the photo gallery (WIP) (don't expect anything to good though), haha. I also serve in Rooted, an NC State 
    campus ministry organization and in my local church.
</p>

    If you have any questions about courses, NC State, E 115, or any of my interests, feel free to send me an email (NCSU: bbond@ncsu.edu, Personal: bond.brody.d@gmail.com) 
    or use the Contact Me page. Have a blessed day!
