<p> 
    Hey folks! I'm Brody, a Computer Science student at NC State and President of Rooted, an NC State student-run Christian 
    campus ministry. My undergraduate degree was focussed mostly on cybersecurity and software engineering, so grad school has 
    been a blast because I've gotten to learn about <i>lots</i> of things I missed in undergrad such as data mining 
    (this is my plug for CSC 522)!
</p>

<p>
    In addition to school, I also work as a Lab Admin for E 115 which basically means I'm here to help students, TAs, and the 
    Course Instructors effectively get done what needs to be done. My favorite part of being a Lab Admin though are my office 
    hours as I get to interact with students and thus meet a lot of cool people; if you're an E 115 student, feel free to drop 
    by my office hours - either for help or just to talk!
</p>

<p> 
    In my free time, I love to hike, sleep, play board games, listen to music, and and study the Bible - I am currently going 
    through OT/NT in a year plan and an in-depth study of Colossians! I also serve in Rooted, an NC State campus ministry 
    organization and in my local church. All of this - everything - by God's grace.
