<p> 
    I'm Brody, a Computer Science student at NC State and President of Rooted, an NC State student-run Christian 
    campus ministry. My undergraduate degree was focussed mostly on cybersecurity and software engineering, so grad school has 
    been a blast because I've gotten to learn about <i>lots</i> of things I missed in undergrad such as data mining 
    (this is my plug for CSC 522)!
</p>

<p>
    In addition to school, I TA for CSC 110: The Beauty and Joy of Computing and was formerly a lead TA for E 115: Introduction to 
    Computing Environments for about 2.5 years. My job as a TA basically means I'm here to help students, TAs, and the Course Instructors 
    effectively get done their tasks. My favorite part of being a (lead) TA though are office hours as I get to interact with students and 
    thus meet a lot of cool people; if you're a CSC 110 student, feel free to drop by my office hours - either for help or just to talk!
</p>

<p> 
    In my free time, I love to hike, sleep, play board games, listen to music, and study the Bible - I am currently going 
    through OT/NT in a year plan and recently finished an in-depth study of Colossians! All of this - everything - by God's grace.
