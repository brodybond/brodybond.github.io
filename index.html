<p> 
    I'm Brody, a recently-graduated Master of Computer Science student at NC State, former President of Rooted (an NC State student-run Christian 
    campus ministry), and Teaching Assistant (and lead TA... and a TA Senator).
</p>
    
<p>
    My undergraduate degree focused primarily on cybersecurity and software engineering, so grad school has been a blast because I've gotten to learn 
    about <i>lots</i> of things I missed in undergrad such as data mining, UI/UX design, operations research, and advanced SWE practices (think DevOps).
    I love the problem-solving aspect of software engineering, the practicality of cybersecurity, the beneficial/time-saving aspect of automation, and the
    joy of working with customers and teammates to deliver products. In all my projects, I strive to bring my skills to bear.
</p>

<p>
    As mentioned before, I was a Teaching Assistant for three years. I helped teach CSC 110: The Beauty and Joy of Computing and was formerly the lead TA for 
    E 115: Introduction to Computing Environments where I managed 10–15 TAs per semester, aided in course refactors, led the development of new course materials,
    streamlined TA onboarding, and advocated for student success. I also served as a TA Senator, during which I collaborated with a team of experienced TAs
    to improve content for multiple undergraduate Computer Science courses and contributed to a departmental analysis to guide funding and decision-making 
    for upper-level academic administrators.
</p>

<p> 
    In my free time, I love to hike, play board games and pickleball, (horribly) drum on the cajón, listen to music, and study the Bible (currently going through a chronological plan which I highly recommend).
    I am incredibly thankful to the Lord for the experiences that have made me who I am.
