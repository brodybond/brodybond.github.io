                To prevent academic dishonesty (cheating/plagiarism), most classes restrict what code can be published online even for résumé purposes. For this reason, most of the projects listed below
                do not have publicly-accessible codebases; I've included code/papers/slides where possible.

                    As part of the graduate level SWE course, my team of three overhauled an application and implemented new functionality. I personally added Google 
                    sign-ups/sign-ins and implemented maps for users to view locations of interest while assisting my team with the UI overhaul and the introduction of an itinerary system 
                    for users to plan out their trips. (<a href="https://github.com/Gunabana/CityByte"><u><u>Codebase</u></u></a>)                        </p>

                    My teammate and I explored and utilized IBM's mid-circuit resets on some of their Quantum Computers in order to find a secret string. 
                    We used the BV algorithm (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein%E2%80%93Vazirani_algorithm">Wikipedia</a>) as a basis for our computations, but reset 
                    both qubits after computing the answer for each bit of the secret string. This increased the run time from O(1) to O(n), however it decreased the qubits needed to solve from n to 2. 
                    This is actually a decent trade-off given quantum computers <i> currently </i> do not have many qubits, but admittedly because our solution ran in O(n) time, it could
                    also be solved on a traditional computer; nonetheless, it was a great foray into the world of quantum algorithms.

                            NC State focuses heavily on SWE, so below are the descriptions of a few SWE courses. From recollection, I've received an A, A+, or "A++" (>100 although officially just an A+) 
                            in all my SWE courses.
                            <ul style="font-size: 1em; color: #444;">
                                <li>
                                    CSC 216: an introductory yet intense SWE course that teaches you the basics of OOP (via Java), utilizing test cases, debugging, and a few best-practices.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    CSC 326: a more in-depth SWE class that focuses out SWE best practices (e.g. git/revision control, working with teams, documentation, {black, white} box testing, etc.), 
                                    system design, and implementation. This was one of my favorite classes.
                                </li>

                                    CSC 510: a graduate-level software engineering class that covered everything from the conceptual to the nitty-gritty (and somewhat niche parts) of SWE. Two major takeaways from 
                                    experiences in this class was 1) acclimating to codebases quickly, utilizing them, and improving upon them and 2) teaching, equipping, and encouraging those newer to or less proficient in SWE.

                            Don't let the name fool you, this was a class on ethical hacking. We covered a plethora of topics from hardware exploits to reverse engineering to "softer" concepts like the underworld economy and analysis of unethical hacking. Many of the assignments focused on gaining privileged access to systems, sort of like mini-CTFs but with one topic of focus at a time.

I will be taking the graduate-level version of this course in the Spring of 2025.
