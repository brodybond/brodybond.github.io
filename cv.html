<p>
    Hello! Below is my current resume (with a bit of information removed as I'm putting it on a public website), a list of important classes I've completed,
    and a more extensive list, compared to my resume, of projects I have worked on during my last six or so years of education.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center; color:#222;"> Projects </h2>

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #222;"> Classes Taken </h2>
<p style="text-align:center; color: #222"> A non-exhaustive list of CompSci/SWE courses that were formative to me (along with one or two that were just plain fun). I've marked 'U' or 'G' to indicate if they 
    were taken at the undergraduate or graduate level respectively (mostly because graduate courses required a survey/paper and/or research of some kind).

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center; gap: 40px; margin-top: 20px;">
    <!-- Column 1 -->
    <div style="flex: 1 1 45%; min-width: 300px; max-width: 600px;">
        <div style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; color: #333; margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: center;">Software Engineering (U/G)</div>
        <p style="font-size: 1em; color: #444; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 15px; text-align: center;">NC State focuses heavily on SWE, so below are the descriptions of a few SWE courses. From recollection, I've received an A, A+, or "A++" (>100 although officially just an A+) 
            in all my SWE courses.
            <ul style="font-size: 1em; color: #444;">
                <li>
                    CSC 216: an introductory yet intense SWE course that teaches you the basics of OOP (via Java), utilizing test cases, debugging, and a few best-practices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    CSC 326: a more in-depth SWE class that focuses out SWE best practices (e.g. git/revision control, working with teams, documentation, {black, white} box testing, etc.,.), 
                    the design of systems, and of course implementing designs. This was one of my favorite classes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    CSC 510: a graduate-level software engineering class that covered everything from the conceptual to the nitty-gritty (and somewhat niche parts) of SWE. Two major takeaways from 
                    experiences in this class was 1) acclimating to codebases quickly, utilizing them, and improving upon them and 2) teaching, equipping, and encouraging those newer to or less proficient in  SWE.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <div style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; color: #333; margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: center;">Quantum Computing (G)</div>
        <p style="font-size: 1em; color: #444; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 15px; text-align: center;"> 
            An introductory quantum computing (QC) class covering basic quantum physics and theory, QC architecture, QC programming, and the analysis, design, and implementation of QC algorithms on 
            simulated and actual quantum computers with a focus on real-world application. </p>

        <div style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; color: #333; margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: center;">Automated Learning & Data Analysis (G) </div>
        <p style="font-size: 1em; color: #444; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 15px; text-align: center;">A course that combined the fields of data science and machine learning with the application of utilizing machine learning and conducting data mining. 
        </p>

        <div style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; color: #333; margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: center;">Content, Assessment, and Pedagogy (G)</div>
        <p style="font-size: 1em; color: #444; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 15px; text-align: center;"> One of my favorite classes at NC State! We learned and discussed various (proposed) "methods" of learning,
            how to structure material for effective understanding, and how to asses the process of education in order to improve the cycle of learning. Prior to taking the class, I thought it would be mediocre as that was my 
            perception of education as a field, however I have utilized information or concepts from that class in nearly every aspect of my life whether it be teaching as a TA, communicating effectively in everyday life,
            or analyzing and improving my own learning patterns. I also enjoyed that the class was <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meta">meta</a>, and education as a field of research can be incredibly practical.
        </p>

    <!-- Column 2 -->
    <div style="flex: 1 1 45%; min-width: 300px; max-width: 600px;">
        <div style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; color: #333; margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: center;">Software Security (U) </div>
        <p style="font-size: 1em; color: #444; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 15px; text-align: center;"> A very fun class that covered the essentials about secure software development. Topics included the classic CIA triad, threat analysis and planning,
            the security ecosystem (CVEs, MITRE), useful tools (Wireshark, fuzzers), and web exploitation. TL;DR: <a style="color:rgb(38, 14, 175)"> blue team. </a> </p>

        <div style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; color: #333; margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: center;">Computer Security (U) </div>
        <p style="font-size: 1em; color: #444; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 15px; text-align: center;">Don't let the name fool you, this was more-so a class on exploitation/hacking (although naming it 'Computer Hacking' probably wouldn't pass muster with the powers that be).
            We covered a ton of topics in this course from hardware exploits to reverse engineering to "softer" concepts such as the going-rate for different vulnerabilities. Many of the assignments focussed on gaining privileged access to systems, 
            sort of like mini-CTFs but with one topic of focus at a time, and culminated in a CTF hosted by NC State's hacking club, <a href="https://hackpack.club/">HackPack</a>. The course is taught by a member of the 
            <a href="https://oooverflow.io/philosophy.html#the-order-of-the-overflow"> Order of the Overflow</a> which <strike>hosts</strike> hosted <a href="https://defcon.org/index.html">DEF CON CTF</a>. TL;DR: <a style="color:rgb(207, 30, 30)"> red team. </a>
        </p>

        <div style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; color: #333; margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: center;">Network Security (U) </div>
        <p style="font-size: 1em; color: #444; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 15px; text-align: center;">This class had surprisingly little to do with networks once we finished a short summary of the TCP/IP layers and primarily focussed
            on encryption, the CIA triad (at a higher level than SWSec), firewalls, automation, and the like. From this class, I discovered the <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/show/4YeKi2aGfxuhGj2QqazzVV?si=012ec7adfc0249fb">Open Source Security Podcast</a> which I highly recommend.
        </p>
    
        <div style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; color: #333; margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: center;">Computer Networks (G)</div>
        <p style="font-size: 1em; color: #444; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 15px; text-align: center;">The course covered concepts such TCP/IP in-depth, error checking and correction, and the mathematics and
            implementation of various forms of wireless communication (wifi/802.11b, 5G, multiplexing, etc.,). As part of this class, I completed a topical survey with a team on Disconnected, Intermittent, Limited (DIL) environments
            which has utility in military and emergency situations.
        </p>

        <div style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; color: #333; margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: center;">Data Structures and Algorithms (U/G)</div>
        <p style="font-size: 1em; color: #444; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 15px; text-align: center;">For the undergraduate class, we went over the analysis, design, and implementation of various algorithms 
            (e.g. bubble sort, merge sort, radix sort, etc., - all the classics) and data structures & related concepts (e.g. linked lists, queuing, concatenation, etc.,). I will be taking the graduate level version of this course in the Spring of 2025. </p>
